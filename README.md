# SQL_Walmart_Sales_Analysis

The primary objective of this project is to gain insights into Walmart's Sales data in order to understand the various factors influencing the sales of its different branches.

## Data Normalization:

1) Build a database
2) Create table and insert the data.
3) Select columns with null values in them - There are no null values in our database as in creating the table we set NOT NULL for each field, hence null values 
   are filtered out.
4) Add a new column named "time_of_day" to give insight of sales in the Morning, Afternoon and Evening. This will help answer the question on which part of the day 
   most sales are made.
5) Add a new column named "day_name" that contains the extracted days of the week on which the given transaction took place (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur, Fri). This will 
   help answer the question on which week of the day each branch is busiest.
6) Add a new column named "month_name" that contains the extracted months of the year on which the given transaction took place (Jan, Feb, Mar..). This helps to determine which month of the year has the most sales and profit.
